## What is the goal of this book?

To provide students with a deep understanding of the essential concepts of

## What are the essential concepts of programming languages?

Most of the essential concepts of programming languages relate to the
semantics, or meaning, of program elements.

Interpreters are used to express the semantics of many essential language
elements.

The exercises are vital. The book explains the key concepts, and the exercises
explore alternative designs and other issues.
