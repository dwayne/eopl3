# Expressions

## Key Points

We always need a front end that converts programs into abstract syntax trees.

It's all basically interpreters.

A declaration introduces a variable as a name for some value and a reference
uses the variable.

We can use lexical depth to get rid of variable names entirely.

## Notes

In this chapter, we study the binding and scoping of variables.

### 3.1 Specification and Implementation Strategy

The specification will consist of assertions of the form

```
(value-of exp ρ) = val
```

meaning that the value of expression `exp` in environment `ρ` is `val`.

- We write down rules of inference and equations that enable us to derive the
  assertions.
- We use the rules and equations by hand to find the intended value of some
  expressions.

The goal is to write a program that implements the language.

**Execution via interpreter**

*program text -> [Front End] -> syntax tree -> [Interpreter] -> answer*

**Execution via compiler**

*program text -> [Front End] -> syntax tree -> [Compiler] -> translated program -> [Interpreter or Machine] -> answer*

*[Front End]*: converts program text into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

*[Interpreter]*: a program that looks at a data structure (the AST) and performs
actions that depend on its structure.

The **source language** or **the defined language** is the text of the program
written in the language we are implementing.

The **implementation language** or **the defining language** is the language in
which the interpreter is written.

In the compiler organization the **target language** is often machine language,
which is interpreted by a hardware machine. Another possibility is that the
target language is a special-purpose language called a **byte-code**, and its
interpreter is called a **virtual machine**.

A compiler is typically divided into 2 parts:

1. An **analyzer**. It attempts to deduce useful information about the program.
2. A **translator**. It does the translation, possibly using information from
the analyzer.

No matter what implementation strategy we use, we need a front end that converts
programs into abstract syntax trees.

The front end can be grouped into 2 stages:

1. **Scanning**. It is the process of dividing the sequence of characters into
words, numbers, punctuation, comments and the like. These units are called
**lexical items**, **lexemes** or **tokens**. The **lexical specification**
specifies the way in which a program should be divided up into tokens.

2. **Parsing**. It is the process of organizing the sequence of tokens into
hierarchical syntactic structures such as expressions, statements and blocks.
We refer to this as the **syntactic** or **grammatical** structure of the
language. The parser takes a sequence of tokens from the scanner and produces
an abstract syntax tree.

The standard approach to building a front end is to use a **parser generator**.
A parser generator is a program that takes a lexical specification and a
grammar, and produces a scanner and a parser for them.

### 3.2 LET: A Simple Language

An important part of the specification of any programming language is the set
of values that the language manipulates. Each language has at least two such
sets:

1. The **expressed values** which are the possible values of expressions.
2. The **denoted values** which are the values bound to variables.

If we are going to evaluate expressions containing variables, we will need to
know the value associated with each variable. We do this by keeping those
values in an environment.

An environment is a function whose domain is a finite set of variables and
whose range is the denoted values.

```
env : Identifier -> DenVal
```

**Syntax for the LET language**

```
Program    ::= Expression
               [(a-program exp)]

Expression ::= Number
               [(const-exp n)]

           ::= -(Expression, Expression)
               [(diff-exp exp1 exp2)]

           ::= zero? (Expression)
               [(zero?-exp exp)]

           ::= if Expression then Expression else Expression
               [(if-exp exp1 exp2 exp3)]

           ::= Identifier
               [(var-exp v)]

           ::= let Identifier = Expression in Expression
               [(let-exp v exp body)]
```

**Semantics for the LET language**

```
ExpVal = Int + Bool
DenVal = Int + Bool


(value-of-program (a-program exp))
= (value-of exp ρ) ; for some initial environment ρ


(value-of (const-exp n) ρ)
= (num-val n)


(value-of (var-exp v) ρ)
= (apply-env ρ v) ; since DenVal = ExpVal this works


(value-of (diff-exp exp1 exp2) ρ)
= (num-val
    (- (expval->num (value-of exp1 ρ))
       (expval->num (value-of exp2 ρ))))


   (value-of exp ρ) = val
----------------------------
(value-of (zero?-exp exp) ρ)
= (bool-val #t) if (expval->num val) == 0
= (bool-val #f) if (expval->num val) /= 0


     (value-of exp1 ρ) = val1
------------------------------------
(value-of (if-exp exp1 exp2 exp3) ρ)
= (value-of exp2 ρ) if (expval->bool val1) == #t
= (value-of exp3 ρ) if (expval->bool val1) == #f


     (value-of exp ρ) = val
---------------------------------
(value-of (let-exp v exp body) ρ)
= (value-of body [v=val]ρ)
```

### 3.3 PROC: A Language with Procedures

*What information must be included in a value representing a procedure?*

The **lexical scope rule** tells us that when a procedure is applied, its body
is evaluated in an environment that binds the formal parameter of the procedure
to the argument of the call. Variables occurring free in the procedure should
also obey the lexical binding rule.

Consider,

```
let x = 200
in let f = proc (z) -(z,x)
   in let x = 100
      in let g = proc (z) -(z,x)
         in -((f 1), (g 1))
```

Both `f` and `g` are created from identical expressions but they must behave
differently. Hence, the value of a `proc` expression must depend in some way on
the environment in which it is evaluated. Furthermore, any other variables must
have the same values they had at procedure-creation time.

The data structures used to represent procedures (as they have been specified)
are called **closures**, because they are self-contained: they contain
everything the procedure needs in order to be applied. The procedure is
**closed over** or **closed in** its creation environment.

**Syntax for the PROC language**

```
Expression ::= proc (Identifier) Expression
               [(proc-exp v body)]

           ::= (Expression Expression)
               [(call-exp rator rand)]
```

**Semantics for the PROC language**

```
ExpVal = Int + Bool + Proc ; => procedures can be the result of expressions
DenVal = Int + Bool + Proc ; => procedures can be bound to variables

; Proc is an abstract data type for procedures.
; Its interface includes:
; - procedure, a constructor to build a procedure value
; - apply-procedure, an observer to apply a procedure value


(value-of (proc-exp v body) ρ)
= (proc-val (procedure v body ρ))


(value-of (call-exp rator rand) ρ)
= (let ((proc (expval->proc (value-of rator ρ)))
        (arg (value-of rand ρ)))
    (apply-procedure proc arg))


(apply-procedure (procedure v body ρ) val)
= (value-of body [v=val]ρ)
```

**N.B.** *The example given in the book on `pg 77` is quite informative.*

**N.B.** *There is a similarity between the value of `let-exp` and
`apply-procedure`.*

### 3.4 LETREC: A Language with Recursive Procedures

LETREC adds recursion.

Consider,

```
letrec double(x) = if zero?(x) then 0 else -((double -(x,1)), -2)
in (double 6)
```

The `double` inside the body of the procedure needs to be executed in an
environment where `double` is defined.

```
Expression ::= letrec Identifier (Identifier) = Expression in Expression
               [(letrec-exp proc-name bound-var proc-body letrec-body)]


(value-of (letrec-exp proc-name bound-var proc-body letrec-body) ρ)
= (value-of
    letrec-body
    (extend-env-rec proc-name bound-var proc-body ρ))
```

**What is the desired behavior of
`(extend-env-rec proc-name bound-var proc-body ρ)`?**

Let `ρ1` be the environment produced by
`(extend-env-rec proc-name bound-var proc-body ρ)`. Then what should
`(apply-env ρ1 var)` return?

```
if var == proc-name then
  (proc-val (procedure bound-var proc-body ρ1))
else
  (apply-env ρ var)
```

### 3.5 Scoping and Binding of Variables

In most programming languages, variables may appear in two different ways: as
**references** or as **declarations**.

A variable **reference** is a use of the variable.

A **declaration** introduces the variable as a name for some value.

A variable reference is **bound by** the declaration with which it is
associated. It is **bound** to its value.

Declarations in most programming languages have a limited scope, so that the
same variable name may be used for different purposes in different parts of a
program.

Rules to determine the declaration to which each variable reference refers are
called **scoping** rules.

The portion of the program in which a declaration is valid is called the
**scope** of the declaration.

Properties which can be computed without executing the program are called
**static properties**. For e.g. in LET, PROC and LETREC we can determine which
declaration is associated with each variable use without executing the program.

**How to find the corresponding declaration for a given use of a variable?**

To find which declaration corresponds to a given use of a variable, we search
outward from the use until we find a declaration of the variable.

The scoping rules described above are called **lexical scoping rules**. The
variables declared in this way are called **lexical variables**.

**Lexical scoping**

- We can create a hole in a scope by redeclaring a variable. Such an inner
declaration **shadows** the outer one.
- Lexical scopes are nested. Each scope lies entirely within another scope. We
can illustrate this with a **contour diagram**.

**Bindings and extent**

The association between a variable and its value is called a **binding**.

The **extent** of a binding is the time interval during which the binding is
maintained.

In our little languages, all bindings have **semi-infinite extent**. Once a
variable gets bound, that binding must be maintained indefinitely (at least
potentially).

In languages with semi-infinite extent, the garbage collector collects bindings
when they are no longer reachable. This can only be determined at run-time, so
we say that this is a **dynamic** property.

"dynamic" sometimes means "during the evaluation of an expression". Other times
it means "not calculable in advance".

If we did not allow a procedure to be used as the value of a `let`, then
let-bindings would expire at the end of the evaluation of the let body. This
is called **dynamic extent**, and it is a static property. Dynamic binding
behaves similarly.

### 3.6 Eliminating Variable Names

The number of contours crossed is called the **lexical** (or **static**)
**depth** of the variable reference. Is is customary to use
"zero-based indexing", thereby not counting the last contour crossed.

By using lexical depth we could get rid of variable names entirely.

Each variable reference is replaced by its lexical depth; this number uniquely
identifies the declaration to which it refers. These numbers are called
**lexical addresses** or **de Bruijn indices**.

This way of recording the information is useful because the lexical address
predicts just where in the environment any particular variable will be found.

Every variable is found in the environment at the place predicted by its lexical
depth.

### 3.7 Implementing Lexical Addressing

*Parse -> [AST] -> Translate -> [Nameless AST] -> Evaluate*

**The Translator**

The target language will have `nameless-var-exp`, `nameless-let-exp` and
`nameless-proc-exp` that were not in the source language. And it will lose the
constructs that they replace namely `var-exp`, `let-exp` and `proc-exp`.

```
Expression ::= %lexref number
               [(nameless-var-exp num)]

           ::= %let Expression in Expression
               [(nameless-let-exp exp body)]

           ::= %lexproc Expression
               [(nameless-proc-exp body)]
```

Our translator will reject any program that has one of these new nameless
constructs.

Our interpreter will reject any program that has one of the old nameful
constructs.

To calculate the lexical address of any variable reference, we need to know the
scopes in which it is enclosed.

So `translation-of` will take two arguments: an expression and a **static
environment**. The static environment will be a list of variables, representing
the scopes within which the current expression lies.

Looking up a variable in the static environment means finding its position in
the static environment, which gives a lexical address.

Entering a new scope will mean adding a new element to the static environment.

We are trying to translate an expression `e` which is sitting inside the
declarations represented by `senv`. To do this, we recursively copy the tree
except that:

1. Every `var-exp` is replaced by a `nameless-var-exp` with the right lexical
address.
2. Every `let-exp` is replaced by a `nameless-let-exp`.
3. Every `proc-exp` is replaced by a `nameless-proc-exp`.

**The Nameless Interpreter**

Our interpreter takes advantage of the predictions of the lexical-address
analyzer to avoid explicitly searching for variables at run time.

Instead of having full-fledged environments, we will have nameless
environments. We can implement a nameless environment as a list of denoted
values.

There are only two things in our interpreter that use environments: procedures
and `value-of`.
