# Inductive Sets of Data

## Key Points

Formal techniques for specifying sets of values:

- Inductive specification
  - Types of definition
    - Top-down
    - Bottom-up
    - Rules of inference
- Grammars

Inductive definitions allows us to:

1. Prove theorems (using Proof by Structural Induction) about the members of
the set.
2. Write programs that manipulate them.

The "Follow the Grammar" recipe is powerful, but sometimes it is not
sufficient. Sometimes auxiliary procedures are needed to help with the
implementation of the main recursive procedure. For e.g. `number-elements`,
`vector-sum`.

## Summary

Introduces the basic programming tools needed to write interpreters, checkers
and similar programs.

Recursion is the core technique.

Section 1.1 and 1.2:

- introduces methods for inductively specifying data structures
- shows how such specifications may be used to guide the construction of
recursive programs

Section 1.3:

- shows how to extend the techniques to more complex problems

Section 1.4:

- extensive set of exercises to provide experiences that is essential for
mastering recursive programming
